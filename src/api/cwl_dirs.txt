# Comments must be on their own line
# This file contains a list of directories to search for CWL CommandLineTools.
# It is assumed that within each directory, all of the yml filenames within it
# are unique (i.e. including subdirectories).
# Namespaces can be used to disambiguate name collisions between directories.
# (The namespaces which appear here can be used in the wic: metadata tags.)
# By default, each directory is associated with the namespace 'global', as shown.
